# Howto use: signup for an account at https://digitalocean.com and add the
# below snippet between the dashes (and remove the initial #) as User Data
# along with your SSH Key, then Deploy New Sever (+) with a fully qualified
# hostname (ie; hostname + domainname). When the first activation email
# arrives in your mailbox then add the IP to whatever is your DNS system to
# resolve the FQDN hostname you supplied and wait at least another 5 minutes
# for the NetServa setup email to arrive (change MAILTO= below). If DNS
# resolves to the server then you should be able to gain access via...

# ssh -p9 -i ~/.ssh/YOUR_SSHKEY root@YOUR_NEW_FQDN_HOSTNAME (or IP)
